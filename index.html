  <h1>BAHATI MOBILE PHARMACY</h1>

<img src="truck clinic.jpg"alt="tuck clinic">
  <p>I came up with this idea to cater for the problems in my  society<br>like of medicines to cure diseases<p>
  <p>This is not easy because our area <br>is rural and to move to different places as you distribute medicines is  very hard<p>
<p>This mobile pharmacy is very easy to achieve because you are  able  to get treatment at ease without any struggle.Moresoever it will be everytime avilable at all times.I
n doing  this, iwould have saved most of peoples lives and those with no transport not to walk for a long distance</p>

<p>This pharmacy will most of the time be operating in a van which will be mostly full  of medicine and all the rerquirements of treatment be also available.Since it  going
 to be done in rural area ,am going  to train   the rural healthcare professionals.<br>They have to provide a range of  care,for a range of conditions to people across the cyc
 le.It requires avalid prescriptions.Online  pharmacy should have physical Adddress  so as the drug  authority can inspect quality and standards of online pharmacy</p>
 <br>
  <h2>CHALLENGES THAT I AM UNDERGOING IN THIS BUSINESS</h2>
The problems that iam was going through are:
<li>
  my business was not licensed but right know it has  been registered in the pharmaceutical coucil.</LI>
  <Li>i had no enough money to set up the business.</Li>
<p>I am yearning to expang my project and link it to different places of the country.</p>
    <img src="clinic.jpg">
    <li>most of the roads are not passable .</li>
    <li>some times its very hard to acquire medicines</li>
  <p>This business will run mostly in a van which will be amobile clinic-van.In this van all the activities will take place there and it will be properly done with the workers in there and cleanliness of high level will be observed.
<p>Every time mobile pharmacy is responding to peoples problems and taking action where possible.</p>
<p>That is when you realise that we are having alot of people taking medications there</p>
